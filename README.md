## Repository with Python Analytical Problem Solutions in Jupyter Notebook

Welcome to my repository with Python problem solutions in Jupyter Notebook! Here you will find various analytical problems and their solutions that I have developed and implemented while learning and applying the Python programming language.

### The repository is organized as follows:
Seminar_1: Topic "Computations with Numpy", Topic "Working with Data in Pandas"
Seminar_2: Topic "Data Visualization with Matplotlib"
Seminar_3: Topic "Supervised Learning"
Seminar_4: Topic "Unsupervised Learning"
Seminar_5: Topic "Course Project"

### How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local device:
git clone https://github.com/your_user/your_repository.git
